# MOT_SORT
Multi-object tracking using the SORT Algorithm

This project provides a multi-object tracking implementation using the Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT) algorithm. The SORT algorithm is a tracking algorithm that operates on bounding boxes generated by an object detector.

## Dependencies 
This project requires the following dependencies:
- Computer Vision Toolbox for MATLAB
- Sensor Fusion Toolbox for MATLAB

## Usage
The SORT.m file has the main driver code. Provide the link of your video, mat structure for detections and ground truth. 

## Liscense
This project is licensed under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for more information.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
